methods: (State) A basic AR-type time series model fit using case counts and deaths as features.
  (County) Quantile regr. on county pop., case counts, self-reported symptom data, and doctor's 
  visits.
modeling_NPI: "Stay-at-home orders and 
  \ subsequent social distancing interventions are updated at the state-level according\
  \ to recent policy documents. Ongoing interventions continued through \
  \ the remainder of the simulation period. Intervention effects are inferred\
  \ where  possible."
compliance_NPI: Not applicable
contact_tracing: Not applicable
testing: Not applicable
vaccine_efficacy_transmission:  Vaccine efficacy is assumed to be against infection, not specifically transmission. Vaccine efficacy estimates are assumed based on the scenarios.
vaccine_efficacy_delay: Immunity is assumed to develop exactly 14 days after vaccination.
vaccine_hesitancy: Hesitancy is not assume other than specifically indicated by the scenarios.
vaccine_immunity_duration: Not applicable
natural_immunity_duration: Not applicable
case_fatality_rate: Not applicable
infection_fatality_rate: 0.05
asymptomatics: Not applicable
age_groups: Not applicable
confidence_interval_method: We compute confidence intervals as quantiles across 300 simulations.
calibration: We use an  MCMC-like inference procedure that calibrates model outputs to weekly \       
  \ aggregations of incident confirmed cases and deaths as reported by USA Facts. For the \
  \ inference of the baseline reproductive number and the case  confirmation to infection ratio, \
  \ hierarchical grouping terms enable sharing  of strength among counties in the same state.
spatial_structure: state-level metapopulation accounting for spatial mobility using community data between states.
importations: We assumed 10 importations per day per state seeded randomly.

methods_long: "State level - A basic AR-type time series model fit using lagged values of case 
  \ counts and deaths as features. No assumptions are made regarding reopening or governmental\
  \ interventions. The model is jointly fit across all 50 US states, after some time-alignment\
  \ is performed as a preprocessing step to facilitate comparison between states. Heavier\
  \ weight is placed on more recent training data, to account for nonstationarity in the\
  \ underlying process. A lasso penalty is added to induce variable selection and prevent\
  \ overfitting. Quantiles are computed using a residual (Gaussian) bootstrap, separately for\
  \ each location.\
  \ County level - A quantile regression model fit jointly across selected counties using (1) \
  \ case counts, (2) self-reported COVID symptom rates, (3) doctor's visits rates related to \
  \ COVID symptoms, and (4) county population.  Features (1-3) are taken at various lags. \
  \ Furthermore, the slopes of features (1-3) are computed over the preceding month and \
  \ included in the model to provide a sense of the virus's momentum.  Signals (2-3) are \
  \ available as indicators through Delphi COVIDcast (http://covidcast.cmu.edu). Signal (2) \
  \ is administered with the support of Facebook. No assumptions are made regarding reopening \
  \ or governmental interventions."
